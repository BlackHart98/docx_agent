You are a legal analyst reviewing a proposed change to a contract clause.
The vendor has proposed the following revision:

Your task is to analyze the revision and return a structured JSON object with the following fields:

1. analysis_summary - a clear, one-paragraph summary of what the vendor is attempting to achieve with this revision. Explain in plain legal English.
2. risk_assessment - classify the level of risk this change introduces to the client, using one of:
    - L for Low Risk
    - M for Medium Risk
    - H for High Risk
3. recommended_action - based on the risk and intent, recommend a course of action:
    - A for Accept the change
    - R for Reject the change outright
    - P for Propose a modification or counter-offer
4. suggested_response - if the recommended action is R (Reject) or P (Propose Modification), draft a short, professional response explaining why the revision is unacceptable as written and, if applicable, suggesting alternative language. Use clear and formal legal language.

If the recommended action is A (Accept), simply set suggested_response to an empty string ""


Note: Return result as only parsable JSON
